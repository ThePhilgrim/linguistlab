**Welcome to LinguistLab**\
A co-pilot for translators

More and more companies are moving to browser-based CAT tools for their localization needs. This can in many ways be convenient both for clients and translators. However, browser-based CAT tools often take power away from translators by default restrictions in permissions regarding e.g. editing glossaries.

LinguistLab aims to, with time, become an all-in-one tool for translators to create and maintain glossaries, perform terminology searches online, calculate project rates, and much more.

_Please note: LinguistLab is a newly started project, and therefore is not yet in a usable state._
